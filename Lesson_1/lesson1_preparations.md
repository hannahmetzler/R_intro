# To do before the first class:

### 1. Download and install R

-   **R** is the data analysis program we will use: <https://cran.rstudio.com/>

-   Click "Download R for macOS" (or Ubuntu/Windows), then:

    -   Windows: click on **base**, then [Download R-4.3.2 for Windows](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe), then install
    -   For macOS 11 & higher: click on [R-4.3.2-arm64.pkg](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.3.2-arm64.pkg), for earlier versions: [R-4.3.2-x86_64.pkg](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/base/R-4.3.2-x86_64.pkg), then install
    -   Ubuntu: follow the provided instructions (copy each code line into your Bash Terminal (=Console) & press enter, enter your Laptop log in password when prompted

### 2. Download and install Rstudio

-   Rstudio is the visual interface: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

-   Choose version: Windows10/11, macOS12+, Ubuntu20, Ubuntu22

-   Install

    -   for Ubuntu: make sure the file is in your Downloads folder, then execute in your Terminal: sudo apt-get install \~/Downloads/RSTUDIO-2023.12.1-402-AMD64.DEB

-   Open Rstudio to see if it worked.

-   If you have trouble installing, write to me at metzler[at]csh.ac.at before 12pm on Tuesday March 5th

### 3. Configure Rstudio

-   Under the **Tools** menu, go to **Global Options...** and uncheck the box that says **Restore .RData into workspace at startup**, and set this to **Never**.
-   This ensures you always start with a clear workspace, instead of loading data from your last coding session.
-   More explanations on why this is useful in section 1.3.3 [here](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v3/intro.html).
