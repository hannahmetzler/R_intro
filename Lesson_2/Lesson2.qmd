# Goals

-   Organize a project (folder, files, R-project)
-   (Reproducible) reports on your results (Quarto)
-   Back-up (& sharing) of your code (GitHub)
-   Crucial for anyone trying to use your code (including your future self)

# To cover

-   R project
-   folder structure
-   Quarto language basics
-   Including a code junk
-   Push your code

# Organizing a project

-   R-projects group all files of one project: scripts, data files, output
-   File system & file paths
-   File naming

## Steps

-   Make a directory for this class: "R_introduction"
-   In it, create a sub-folder for "Lesson 2", with further sub-folders:
    -   data
    -   scripts
    -   figures
    -   output
-   Open a New Project in Rstudio: Choose `New Project...` under the `File` menu and choose `Create a git repository`
