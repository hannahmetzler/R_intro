## What is this course about? 

This is an introduction to programming your data analyses and visualizations in R, for people who know the basics of statistics, but have never written code before. I had a lot of doubts about being able to write code myself before I started coding myself. When I started coding, I initially found it challenging, but then it was easier than I had thought, and especially a lot of fun! I want to help others jump over barriers of self-doubts and make it easy to start writing your own code!
