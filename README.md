## What is this course about?

This course will introduce you to coding your data analyses and data visualizations with the software R. It is geared for people who know the basics of statistics, but have never written code before. We will set up R, Rstudio and Git, learn how to wrangle and clean data, how to make pretty plots, and how to do basic statistics (descriptives, t-tests, ANOVAs, regressions etc.) in R.

If you have had doubts if you'd be able to write code, but secretly have been wanting to for a long time, this course is for you. In my experience, it seems more challenging and less fun initially than it later turns out to be! Coming from a social science background myself, I want to help others jump over the barrier of self-doubts and make it easy for you to start writing your own code.

This course is based on a free online course book:

You can use it to repeat lessons, understand something better, or catch up if you miss a class.

There are a variety of other free online classes on R, some including an introduction to statistics. You can find a list of courses I have found useful [here](https://github.com/hannahmetzler/R_intro/blob/main/Resources.md). If a course has not been updated recently, it is quite likely that some things have changed, as R and its packages are regularly updated. Most things will still work, however.
